        War. The Syndicate has slowly grown in stature and influence and now serves
        as an important link between the empires and the illegal elements in the outer
        regions. Syndicate space is a pirate haven, but still retains enough civility
        to allow pretty much anyone to travel there to do business. The Syndicate
        markets are always chockfull of contraband goods and illegal wares that are
        hard or impossible to come by elsewhere. Each Syndicate station is an autonomous
        entity, but they cooperate on security and information issues. The unofficial
        leader of the Syndicate is Silphy en Diabel, a former Sister of EVE that returned
        to Syndicate space to save her family''s fortune. Since then she''s turned
        out to be just as resourceful and ruthless as her late father.","faction_id":500009,"is_unique":true,"name":"The

        Sisters of EVE are mainly known for their humanitarian aid efforts to those

        Sisters of EVE base their existence on strong religious beliefs, which they
        have coupled with scientific facts. They believe that the EVE gate is a gateway
        to heaven - that god resides on the other side of the gate. As well as dedicating
        themselves to aiding those in need they are also busy with scientific experiments
        around the EVE gate, hoping to gain a better understanding of the forces at
